The owlbear charges before she can reach her weapon, but a gout of fire from the sky stops the owlbear in its tracks. the gold dragon lands in front of the human, its eyes burning with a fiery vengeance as it snorts, flames billowing from its nostrils. Mounting her dragon, the human lets out a war cry as the dragon takes off into the air.",
						"Shouting a war cry, the dwarf waves his banner in the air, divine light flowing over the battlefield as his allies, a human and a halfling, harass an ogre. The ogre, seeing the origin of this magic, stampedes towards the dwarf, but is quickly stopped as a dragon, its scales a shining platinum, opens its maw and releases a blast of divine energy.",

Lightning sparks at the tip of his arrow, and he grins to himself as he fires at the goblin chief. The arrow finding its mark, the goblin chief can barely cry for help as lightning explodes from his body, arcing off to his nearby guards.",

Letting out a short whistle, a dark dragon, onyx in colour, seems to appear from the shadows with a dead drow in its maw.
