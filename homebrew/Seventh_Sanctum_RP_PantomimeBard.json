				"The College of Pantomime is the home of bards who found that the world is a cacophonous place with too much noise and distractions to truly appreciate the Words of Creation or the magic which stemmed from it. They have therefore opted not to add their voices to the multitudes, instead choosing to remain silent, focusing instead on their movements and intentions to weave their magic as they trace the echoes of the Words of Creations which vibrate throughout the planes.",
				"Bards of this college are often considered odd and off- putting. There’s something about a performer who won’t speak that seems to give onlookers a feeling that something just isn’t right. This can be explained by the fact that these silent performers are in fact altering the weave around them through their intricate and specific movements. Members of this college are usually more level-headed than their counterparts from other colleges, or at least seem so since they cannot voice any ridiculous plans they have out loud. Though those who spend enough time around them to gain an insight into their gesticulations may disagree with the previous assertion.",

The panels exist for up to 1 minute, until you dismiss them as an action or until they are destroyed. The panels are 5 foot squares that are 1 inch thick. A creature can determine the location and orientation of these panels by interacting with them or by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC.",

				"You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and expended uses are replenished when you finish a long rest."
