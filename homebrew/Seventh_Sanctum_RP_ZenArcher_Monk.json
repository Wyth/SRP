				"Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn how to let your ki flow through ranged weaponry, striking further than you could with fists or melee weapons. You gain proficiency in two of the following weapons: light crossbows, hand crossbows, shortbows, or longbows. These weapons are not monk weapons for you and thus do not qualify for use with the Martial Arts feature. At 11th level, the damage die of these weapons increases to {@dice 1d8} (if it is not already), and at 17th level it increases again to {@dice 1d10}."

Before you make an attack on your turn, you may use a bonus action to focus your ki into one of the ranged weapons you chose with your Bonus Proficiencies, causing the first attack you make with that ranged weapon this turn to deal extra damage on a hit equal to your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.",
				"In addition, you gain knowledge of the cantrip {@spell true strike} if you don't already know it, and its range increases to the furthest long range of any ranged weapon you are holding.",
				"Starting at 5th level, you gain the ability to spend 1 ki point to cause the extra damage from Spiritual Archery to apply instead to the first two such ranged weapon attacks you make on your turn.",
				"Alternatively at 5th level, you can also spend 1 ki point to cast your true strike cantrip as a free action. When you cast true strike as a free action this way, the effects of true strike occur immediately, rather than taking a turn to activate."

Your attacks made with the ranged weapons you chose in your Bonus Proficiencies feature count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. You may also use your Stunning Strike feature with ranged weapon attacks.",
				"Additionally, you may choose to make ranged weapon attacks with these chosen weapons as if you were standing in any location that you can see within 30 feet of you, enabling you to curve arrows around walls and cover. The target must still be at least partially visible from your actual location or the attack suffers disadvantage, as normal."

As an action on your turn, you can spend 0-3 ki to produce a line of radiant light 120 feet long and 5 feet wide, which leads away from you in a direction you choose until it strikes a wall at least 1 foot thick or a solid, non-living object of similar thickness. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@dice 4d4} radiant damage plus an additional {@dice 3d4} for every point of ki you spent."
