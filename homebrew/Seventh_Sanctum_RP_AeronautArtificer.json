				"Upon reaching 3rd level, your experiments with flight have paid off. At the end of a long rest, as long as you have access to your woodcarver's tools, you can construct a personal flying machine. You determine its appearance, and it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. You cannot operate your flying machine while wearing heavy armor or while you have a shield or heavy weapon equipped. You must use your woodcarver's tools to maintain your flying machine as part of each long rest or it ceases to function.",

This flight lasts until the end of your current turn, at which point you fall to the ground unless you have a way to remain airborne. While using your flying speed, opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage."
