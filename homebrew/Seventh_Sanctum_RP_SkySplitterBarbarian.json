If you charge the shot until the start of your next turn, you can release the arrow, which fires out from you in a line 600 feet long and 1 inch wide, and ignores cover. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier), taking {@dice 6d8} piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a success. A Large or larger creature has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object in the line that isn't being worn or carried takes maximum damage from the arrow.",
