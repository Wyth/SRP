				"Balance is lost when one disrupts the livelihood of another. Monks of the Way of the Iron Grasp are taught to establish safety and order within their sphere of influence, training relentlessly in martial techniques to pin down foes and protect allies. Many of this tradition wear gauntlets that they forge themselves as a symbol of their dedication and ideals.",
				"Monasteries that teach this tradition often act as militias for nearby settlements or as a council that oversees and rules adjacent villages and towns. The heads of these monasteries offer respect towards even the lowest of peasants, but have no tolerance for troublemakers. Still, they risk life and limb to hold the peace when external threats arise, regardless of who needs protection."
