							"Marking a sword as a fake is a process that takes several hours, involving the act of manifesting the blade as part of your own will. Studying a sword this way does not consume the sword, but rather adds to your knowledge the ability to replicate it at will. To do so requires one hour of unimpeded concentration and a quiet location to which your studies can be performed. A fake within your folder lasts forever, though a fake can be willingly forgotten and replaced with another.",
							"Successfully completing the study of a sword will add it into your folder as a fake. The amount of fakes you can store in your folder increase with level, beginning with 3 fakes at 3rd level. When you complete a long rest, you automatically manifest fakes equal to the amount of maximum fakes in your folder divided by 2 (rounded up) from the swords stored within your folder. You can create additional fakes by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to manifest the fake from your folder into the palm of your hand.",
							"While you have a fake prepared, as a bonus action on your turn, you can manifest it into the palm of your hand and nock it into any bow, so long as that bow is not a crossbow. A fake cannot be wielded as a melee weapon and can only be used as ammunition for a bow. When you manifest a fake on your turn this way, you cannot do so again until your next turn.",
