Finer forms of entertainment are suited to most tastes; however, nature and good weather appeal to the senses just as strongly for these high-headed creatures.

Minotaur youth often fight each other in the Circus as to prove themselves and make the passage from child to adult. While all of these fights used to be to the death, fights now are required to be nonlethal, letting the loser bear the shame of their defeat.",
