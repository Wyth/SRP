				"The Oath of Death is a vow against the unnatural world. To protect the natural flow of life. There comes a time when a creature, regardless of its origin, must pass on and leave this world for the next. Paladins who undertake this oath attempt to ensure that those who extend their life long beyond what is proper can be brought to the Afterlife and join their kin in the beyond.",
				"Paladins of this oath specialize in killing undead like vampires, liches, and ghosts, as well as those who make promises with fiends for eternal life. They may even take the lives of more peaceful beings, so long as their convinctions drive them to pursue an endless existence. A paladin who undertakes this oath may be called many things: a savior, the reaper, death, the law of worlds, or even a cruel assassin.",
